# Agi
Artificial General Intelligence

Plan 2018-09-11
- [ ] sensor input (to nodes level 0) and scanning?
- [ ] node creation / deletion / storage
- [ ] node linking
- [ ]  link influence value
- [ ]  agi mind visualization
- [ ]  default behavior establishment (dopamine, food/sex drive, drive to complete tasks)
- [ ]  web text environment
- [ ]  more senses - image, sound
- [ ]  
- [ ]  
hard problems
- [ ]  node activation mechanism: how common it is,
SubmitNode generative process
Submit linking input to output during generation





- [ ]  Proper input and output with agents and using steps with while function, "assembly line".
- [ ]  Pattern recognition, finding patterns ie goodai text challenge and separating English words using spaces and commas and periods... To compare several agents?
- [ ]  Agi need system skeleton, and reward system?
- [ ]  environment and input. Goal: perform a job for me (play gungeon) so it will need knowledge of it or I teach. Start with basics CPU processing, simple body and input and output and algorithm and agents, interaction teaching, or also I do mind agent modification for desired goal.
SubmitBegin with identifying patterns type*
- [ ]  Society of agents (linking of agents, hierarchy, level >1 agents)
- [ ]  Learning in real environment - Agi learns the concepts of the real environment
- [ ]  
- [ ]  Teaching - Teaching Agi knowledge to apply to a job
SubmitJob assignment - Making Agi do work, profiting from it
SubmitAdvancement, AKA "graduation" - Making Agi autonomous in pursuing its own ambitions in the world
